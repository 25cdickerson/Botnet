# Botnet

## Basics
This program, written in Python, utilizes sockets to create a botnet. A botnet is a group of computers that do the work of a central computer known as command and control.

## Implementation
To implement the botnet, I started with the server (The point that recieves requests and performs them) and the hosts (The point that sends the requests). This is an application level program that utilizes TCP to send packets between computers.

## Tools Utilized
